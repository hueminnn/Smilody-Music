        <h1>PIANO</h1>
        <p>The piano is a keyboard instrument in Western classical music. Sounds are produced by pressing the keys on the keyboard, pulling the hammers in the piano, and striking the steel strings. The piano is called the "king of musical instruments" because of its rich musical expression. There are three types of pianos. The first is the grand piano, which is a type of piano that is professionally used for large-scale performances. The second is the upright piano, which is relatively cheap and is the entry piano for many beginners. Finally, there is the electric piano, which is suitable for replacing the piano in some occasions and is convenient to use in smaller venues.</p>
