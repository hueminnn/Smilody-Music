        <h1>VIOLIN</h1>
        <p>The violin is a super fricative orchestral instrument and the most important instrument in the string section of the modern orchestra. The emergence of the modern violin has a history of more than 300 years. In a symphony orchestra, the first violin and the second violin have different names because they are placed in different positions and have different performance content. The first violin is at the outermost position of the band. It has a bright and delicate voice and very flexible playing. In terms of placement, the second violin is behind the first violin, and its performance is responsible for the harmony and accompaniment of the music.</p>
